Current IT Setup

HubSpot supports regional data hosting. Prior to July 2021, HubSpot's AWS (Amazon web services) environment was solely located in the United States. As of July 2021, HubSpot has a new AWS environment in the European Union. HubSpot accounts are hosted in one of these data hosting locations, and customer data is processed and stored in that location.


Recommendations
Amazon EC2 provide wide section of use cases,  since Hubspot is medium entreprise I would suggest M4 as it is suitable for medium enterprise which can be scaled, Hupspot's seems to fit perfectly in this category. It provides a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse workloads. Under M4 Hubspot can select m4.2xlarge Instance where they will get 8 vCPU's which will provide EBS Strorage type with 1000mbps of dedicated EBS bandwidth.

More than 150,000 companies using HubSpot to scale, it's time to celebrate those that inspire us to innovate, to imagine, and to grow better. (find reference if it's true)..
